"This project demonstrates Association Rule Mining using the Apriori algorithm in Python. I implemented a market basket analysis by identifying frequent itemsets and deriving association rules with defined support and confidence thresholds. This hands-on project helped me understand unsupervised learning, data preprocessing, and pattern discovery in retail datasets using mlxtend and pandas."

# 🧺"Discovering Product Patterns: Apriori-based Rule Mining"

## 🔍 Overview

This beginner-level machine learning project explores **Association Rule Mining** using the **Apriori algorithm**. It focuses on uncovering frequent itemsets and generating meaningful association rules from transaction data — a common use case in **market basket analysis**.

## 🧠 What is Association Rule Mining?

Association Rule Mining is an **unsupervised learning technique** used to find patterns and relationships among data items in large datasets. It's widely used in retail to understand purchasing habits.

## 📊 Algorithms & Techniques

- **Apriori Algorithm** for finding frequent itemsets
- **Association Rules** generation using support and confidence thresholds

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas
- mlxtend
- Jupyter Notebook
## 📈 Output Sample

- Frequent Itemsets with minimum support ≥ 33%
- Association Rules with minimum confidence ≥ 50%

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned:

- How to preprocess transactional data
- How the Apriori algorithm works step-by-step
- How to interpret support and confidence
- Real-world applications of association rule mining
